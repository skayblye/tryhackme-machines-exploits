## Automatic Reverse Shell

An exploit that takes advantage of the **traffic offense management 1.0** service to upload a reverse shell and establish a connection automatically.

_Fun fact: If you know the **URL** for uploading files, then it is not necessary to exploit the SQL injection. It seems that no validations are applied to the user uploading the file._

## Usage:

+ `-v`: Victim's **IP**
+ `-i`: Attacker's **IP**
+ `-p`: The **PORT** where we want our shell
