## 0day Machine Tryhackme

##### Context:
The machine on tryhackme includes an interesting vulnerability that occurred in 2014, where commands could be injected through the `User-Agent`. This vulnerability was called **ShellShock**.

_Note: You can get an idea of it if you find the cgi-bin folder._

---

## Usage:
- `-v`: Victim's **IP**
- `-i`: Attacker's **IP**
- `-p`: The **PORT** where we want our shell

_Note: If you want to view the current directory, you can type script /dev/null -c bash. I tried adding it directly to the exploit, but it only caused more issues, sorry._
