## 0day Machine Tryhackme

Context:
The machine on tryhackme includes an interesting vulnerability that occurred in 2014, where commands could be injected through the User-Agent. This vulnerability was called ShellShock.

Note: You can get an idea of it if you find the cgi-bin folder.

Usage:
-v: Victim's IP
-i: Attacker's IP
-p: The PORT where we want our shell
Note: If you want to view the current directory, you can type script /dev/null -c bash. I tried adding it directly to the exploit, but it only caused more issues, sorry.

Example:
